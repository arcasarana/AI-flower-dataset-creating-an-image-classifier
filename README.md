# AI-flower-dataset-creating-an-image-classifier
This project is split up into two parts.  In Part 1, I work through a Jupyter notebook and implement a deep learning image classifier with PyTorch on a flower dataset.  In part 2, with the deep neural network trained, I convert it into an application for others to use.
